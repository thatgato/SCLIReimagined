# SCLI: Reimagined

### *Scientific Command Line Interface: Reimagined*

## A CLI made mainly for solving mathematical problems that can most commonly be found at school.

### What is the aim of this project?

This project aims at eliminating those time-consuming calculations that students are forced to do when they encounter
certain problems in school or in their homework.

The CLI provides pre-programmed methods to solve some common problems (for example vector calculations) that students
might face.

## Instructions

- Open the executable
- You will be greeted with some categories. Type the number of the category you want to open.
- You may be provided with further categories. Choose the appropriate ones until you reach a command page.
- In the command page, you may select which command to execute
- Then, you will enter that command's execution context, and you can provide parameters to do your calculations.

### Currently in development! Designed for Windows.

*This project is a remake of the original [SCLI](https://github.com/thatgato/SCLI) project I created. I decided to
remake it, because it got very messy very quickly, furthermore, it was my first attempt at creating a C++ project of
such size.*
